### Folder Contents Overview

#### Module 1: Allowed Origins
- This module exports an array named `allowedOrigins`, containing two URLs:
  - `'http://localhost:3000'`
  - `'https://noteflow-web-service.onrender.com'`
- These URLs likely represent the origins from which requests are permitted in a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) setup.

#### Module 2: CORS Options
- This module defines CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) options, allowing requests from specific origins defined in the `allowedOrigins` module.
- If the request origin matches one of the allowed origins or if there is no origin provided, the request is allowed. Otherwise, an error is returned.
- Additionally, it enables credentials and sets the options success status to 200.

#### Module 3: MongoDB Connection
- This module is responsible for connecting to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- It imports the Mongoose library, defines an asynchronous function `connectDB` that attempts to establish a connection to the MongoDB database specified in the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable.
- If an error occurs during the connection attempt, it logs the error to the console.
- Finally, it exports the `connectDB` function to be used elsewhere in the application.
